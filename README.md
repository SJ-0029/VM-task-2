# VM-task-2
Created and managed an AWS EC2 Virtual Machine (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, t2.micro) to learn IaaS concepts. Configured firewall rules, connected via SSH using PuTTY, verified access with Linux commands, and terminated the instance after testing to ensure security, scalability, and cost optimization.
